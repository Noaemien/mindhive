#### Prerequisites: Decent understanding of algebra and calculus
# Summary:

Introduction to deep learning. 

## Pros of deep learning compared to regular machine learning methods

### Feature extraction: 
- Traditional machine learning methods would often require the engineers to hand design a feature extractor
- Deep learning, on the other hand, is able to automatically learn the useful features in data
### Generalisation
- Much like representation learning, deep learning automatically discovers the representations needed for detection and classification. For example: with an images, a neural network would typically detect edges in the first layer and then in subsequent layers it would combine them in various ways to represent shapes.
- With enough layers, very complex functions can be learned
- Increases with more data and computation
- Solves the selectivity-invariance dilemma:
	- Invariance: Being insensitive to certain big changes in input (different angle of photo, different pose of object/person)
	- Selectivity: Being sensitive to very minute changes in the input that are important for discrimination.

## Forms of Deep Learning
The rest of the review gives a general introduction to various deep learning methods.
CNN's, Recurrent neural networks, Feed forward, supervised vs unsupervised.
