#### Prerequisits: Topology basics, NN basics, algebra, calculus

# Summary:

How to understand the inner workings of a neural network.
Link between neural networks and topology.

Gives great intuition on how hidden units act as non-linear deformations of the space so that the input is classifiable by a n-dimensional plane

Manifold Hypothesis
