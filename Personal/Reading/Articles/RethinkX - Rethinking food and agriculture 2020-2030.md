## Notes

Based on the [[Seba Technology Disruption Framework]] 

### Summary:
Ideas based on protein disruption driven by economics:
- Cost of protein will be 5x cheaper by 2030 than existing animal protein
- They will also be more nutritious, better tasting, healthier, more varied
- Modern food products will be of higher quality and cheaper when compared to comparable animal products
- Driven by [[Precision Fermentation]], [[Food-as-Software]]
- 100x More land efficient, 10-25x more feed efficient, 20x more time efficient, 10x more water efficient.
- Less waste


## Part One: The Second Domestication of Plants and Animals

##### The first Domestication:
=> breeding plants and animals
##### The Second: 
=> the mastering of micro-organisms

- Food contains many different nutrients: proteins, fats, carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals
- => Protein is the biggest & the most important

Using micro-organisms one can create any protein desired using chains of amino-acids at a very low price.
#### Technological convergence driving disruption

##### New possibilities in precision biology

Aided by digitalisation, machine/deep learning, enabling the analysis of complex biological structures with far more speed and simplicity (Example: [AlphaFold](https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/)).
Other technologies like CRISPR enable the engineering of organisms designed to produce specific molecules.

##### Rapidly falling costs

Cost of sequencing first human genome (2000) is $1B and took 13 years. Today costs $1k and takes a few days.
Cost of computing, $50M per teraflop in 2000, $60 per teraflop of GPU today
