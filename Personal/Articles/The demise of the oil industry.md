- In 2023, oil use avoided by EVs is almost 1.8 million barrels per day
[BNEF Electric Vehicle Outlook](https://assets.bbhub.io/professional/sites/24/2431510_BNEFElectricVehicleOutlook2023_ExecSummary.pdf)
- Electric vehicles represent approx. 45 million barrels per day
- Estimate 2040 bbl/day to lower to 33.5 million
[Gas car energy consumption](https://www.quora.com/How-much-energy-does-a-car-use)
- 27 mpg for ICE cars
- 1 gallon = 33.7 kwh
- EV: (low end) 2.5 miles/kwh
- ICE: 1.25 miles/kwh
