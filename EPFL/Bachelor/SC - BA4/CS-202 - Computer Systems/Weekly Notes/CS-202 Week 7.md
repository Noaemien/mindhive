Regional ISP's can have a peering relationship to bypass tier-1 ISP fees.
ISP's don't have to have direct physical connection between each other. Can be connected using IXP (Internet Exchange Provider). 
Content / cloud providers can peer with tier-1 ISP's.
Lower tier ISP's used caches to minimise requests to higher tier ISP's.

### Network system calls
