# Notes

## Lecture 1

### Mount Points

#### Multiple file systems

**All systems are mapped to a common root**
**Linux/Unix** file systems can be mapped anywhere into a single tree

**Mount:** Allow multiple file systems on multiple volumes to form a single logical hierarchy
A mount point is an abstraction

#### Benefits:
##### Diverse filesystem types can co-exist in the same namespace
- ext3, ext4, NTFS -> filesystems optimised for hard disks
- iso96000 -> filesystem standards for CDROM
- FAT -> the legacy, universal MS-DOS filesystem
### I/O



#### Lecture 2
