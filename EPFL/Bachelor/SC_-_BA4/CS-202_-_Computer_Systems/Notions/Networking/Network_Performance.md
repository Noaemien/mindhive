# Notions of delay

## Transmission
### Transmission rate
Transmission rate is the rate at which one can push bits into a link. It is typically measured in bits/second.

Often indicated by symbol R.

### Transmission delay
Amount of time to push all N bits of a packet into the link
=> $\frac{\text{Packet length}}{\text{Link transmission rate}}$  

## Propagation
### Propagation speed
Physical speed at which bits are send from source to destination. Measured in m/s.

### Propagation delay
Amount of time to move 1 bit from one end of a link to the other.
=>$\frac{\text{Link length}}{\text{Link propagation speed}}$
