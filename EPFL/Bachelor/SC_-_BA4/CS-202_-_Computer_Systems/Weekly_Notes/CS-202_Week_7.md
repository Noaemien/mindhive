# Notes
## Lecture 1

## What's on an Internet path ?
Internet path is owned and managed by **Internet Service Providers** (ISPs)

Regional ISP's can have a peering relationship to bypass tier-1 ISP fees.
ISP's don't have to have direct physical connection between each other. Can be connected using IXP (Internet Exchange Provider). 
Content / cloud providers can peer with tier-1 ISP's.
Lower tier ISP's used caches to minimise requests to higher tier ISP's.

### Network system calls
- send
- recv
- connect
- listen
- accept
The *Application Programming Interface* (API) exposed to processes for Internet communication

### Layers
Provides an abstraction of what lies below to layer above

### Names (identifiers)
For network interfaces: DNS names, IP addresses, MAC addresses
For processes:Â network-interface name + port number
## Lecture 2

### Basic network performance metrics
- Packet loss
	- the fraction of packets that are lost on the way from src to dest
- Packet delay
	- the time it takes for a packet to get from src dst
	- Many components: transmission, propagation, queuing, processing
	- Depends on network topology, link properties, switch operation, queue capacity, other traffic
- Average throughput
	- the average rate at which dst recieves data
	- in bits per second (bps)

> Packet delay matters for small messages but average throughput matters for bulk transfers
