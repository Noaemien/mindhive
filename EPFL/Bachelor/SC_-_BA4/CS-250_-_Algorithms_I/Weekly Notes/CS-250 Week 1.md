# Notes

## Lecture 1

### Course program:
Data types
Sorting algorithms
Searching algorithms
Graphs

### What is an algorithm

Informally: Computational procedure / sequence of computational steps that *transforms an input into an output*.
An instance is a given input for an algorithm
### Insertion Sort

Construct new list one by one by placing values in the correct position
To find correct position, compare with each value already in list from right to left until pos is found

## Lecture 2

### Analyzing  algorithms

#### Random-access machine (RAM) model
- Instruction executed subsequently
- Simplification: basic instructions take O(1) time:
	- Arithmetic: add, subtract, multiply, divide, remainder, floor, ceiling
	- Data movement: load, store, copy
	- Control: conditional/unconditional branch, subroutine call and return
- We dont worry about precision unless crucial
